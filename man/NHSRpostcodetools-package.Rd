\description{
The main purpose of the package is to extract data from the postcodes.io API for collections of UK postcodes, such as their LSOA (or equivalent), parliamentary constituency, and spatial coordinates. It can also check postcodes for currency/validity and suggest replacement current postcodes for terminated codes.
