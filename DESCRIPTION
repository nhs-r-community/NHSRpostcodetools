Description: Extracts data from the postcodes.io API for a given UK postcode,
    such as its LSOA (or equivalent), parliamentary constituency, and spatial
    coordinates. It can also check a list of postcodes for currency/validity
    and suggest a replacement current postcode for an expired code.
