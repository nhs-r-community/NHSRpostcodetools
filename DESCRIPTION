Description: Extracts data from the postcodes.io API for collections of UK
    postcodes, such as their LSOA (or equivalent), parliamentary constituency,
    and spatial coordinates. It can also check postcodes for currency/validity
    and suggest replacement current postcodes for terminated codes.
