Description: The main purpose of the package is to extract data from the
    postcodes.io API for collections of UK postcodes, such as their LSOA (or
    equivalent), parliamentary constituency, and spatial coordinates. It can
    also check postcodes for currency/validity and suggest replacement current
    postcodes for terminated codes.
