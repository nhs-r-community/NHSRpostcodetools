# NHSRpostcodetools (development version)

* Package created with the functions from package [{myrmidon}](https://github.com/francisbarton/myrmidon) created by Fran Barton. Added `postcode_data_join.R` which uses the [postcodes.io](https://postcodes.io/) API to get additional postcode data and which removes the requirement to save the large file from the [Open Geography Portal](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/postcode-to-output-area-to-lower-layer-super-output-area-to-middle-layer-super-output-area-to-local-authority-district-november-2018-lookup-in-the-uk-3/about) maintained by the ONS (Office of National Statistics).

* Added dependency function `batch_it()`
